Case Study 3: From Chaos to Clarity
How I transformed an 85-feature backlog into a strategic roadmap that accelerated delivery by 25%

The Mess I Walked Into
It was my second week at The Media Ant when I sat in on a sprint planning meeting. The product team was debating which feature to build next - a heated discussion between engineering, sales, and the business unit. Everyone had opinions, but no one had data.
When I opened the backlog later that day, I understood why. 85+ features scattered across different tracking systems. Some were months old, some were duplicates, some were half-baked ideas from customer calls. There was no consistent format - one "feature" might be "improve dashboard" while another was a detailed 10-page spec.
The head of product pulled me aside: "We need to get a handle on this. Engineering doesn't know what to build. Sales keeps promising features we haven't prioritized. Can you help us figure out what actually matters?"
I'd seen prioritization frameworks in theory, but this was my first time applying one at scale. The challenge wasn't just evaluating features - it was creating a system that the entire company could rally behind.

Diagnosing the Real Problem
Before jumping to solutions, I spent time understanding why this chaos existed:
Week 1: Shadow & Listen

Joined 8 stakeholder meetings (product, eng, sales, marketing, customer success)
Sat in on 3 customer calls to hear feature requests in real-time
Asked engineers: "What frustrates you most about our current process?"
Asked sales: "Why do you keep pushing for features that don't get built?"

What I Discovered:

No shared language: Engineering called things "tasks," sales called them "promises," product called them "initiatives"
No shared criteria: Features were chosen based on who shouted loudest, not what drove business value
No visibility: Nobody knew what was in flight, what was next, or when things would ship
No tool: Everything lived in Google Sheets, Slack messages, and people's heads

The head of product said: "Help me evaluate which features matter most. Then find us a tool that can make this visible to everyone."
