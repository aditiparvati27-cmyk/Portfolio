**Detailed Story: Co-founding Wonga Finance Club**
- **Origin:** Inspired by my father teaching me financial literacy early. I noticed only 16.7% of Indian students (and very few women) knew about basic money management. I started the club with 3 peers to change this.
- **Growth:** We grew the community to **700+ members** and conducted **130+ webinars** with industry experts on stocks, mutual funds, and crypto.
- **Impact:** Our mock trading session was a huge hit. Many students opened Demat accounts and started investing because of us. The club is still active and run by juniors, which is my proudest legacy.
- **Philosophy:** "Change begins at home." It taught me that engineering solutions go beyond technical challenges—they empower people to make informed decisions.

## Common Questions - Quick Responses

**GPA/Academic Performance:**
"I'm currently a graduate student at Dartmouth graduating in December 2026, so I don't have a final GPA yet. My focus is on delivering tangible results - like the Capital One project that influenced an $800K investment."

**Tell me about yourself:**
"I'm a product manager pursuing my Master's in Engineering Management at Dartmouth. I have a background in electronics engineering and recently worked at Apsona where I drove $6M in ARR growth. I'm passionate about fintech and building products that empower users. I also co-founded a financial literacy club in college that grew to 700+ members."

**Why product management:**
"I discovered it during a BlackBerry internship. I love bridging technical and business requirements - my engineering background helps me understand feasibility while my product experience taught me to focus on business impact and user needs."

**Biggest failure:**
"I led development of a bulk license assignment tool at Apsona that didn't deliver business value. I underestimated complexity and relied on anecdotal evidence instead of hard data. Now I pressure-test every initiative: Will it drive revenue? Reduce effort? Unlock adoption? If no to all three, it doesn't justify the build."

**Handling ambiguity:**
"At Apsona, I led the pricing transition from product-based to bundled pricing for SMB customers with no clear upselling strategy. I segmented customers by usage patterns, focused on power users, and framed bundles as increased value rather than higher cost. Successfully moved accounts without negative customer fallout."

**Creative problem-solving:**
"When our support team was taking 1+ hour per query due to limited Salesforce knowledge, I built an AI knowledge assistant using NotebookLM with 1,000+ pages of documentation. It took 3 days to set up and reduced resolution time by 75%, saving 20+ hours/week."
