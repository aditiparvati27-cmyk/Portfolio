## Behavioral Stories (STAR Method)

**1. Handling Ambiguity (Pricing Shift at Apsona)**
- **Situation:** Major shift from product-based to bundled pricing. Unclear how SMBs would react.
- **Action:** Segmented customers by usage finding "power users". Framed bundle as "increased value" rather than "cost hike".
- **Result:** Successfully moved accounts without churn. Learned to balance business goals with trust.

**2. Handling Failure (Bulk License Tool)**
- **Situation:** Identified need for bulk license assignment.
- **Failure:** Underestimated complexity (thought 2 weeks, took 1 month+) and didn't validate business impact with data (relied on anecdotes).
- **Result:** Feature was buggy and didn't drive revenue.
- **Lesson:** Now I pressure-test: Will it drive revenue? Reduce effort? Unlock sales? If no, don't build.

**3. Creative Problem Solving (AI Support Bot)**
- **Problem:** Support team lacked Salesforce knowledge; simple queries took 1 hour+.
- **Action:** Instead of weeks of training, I built an internal AI bot (NotebookLM) using 1000+ pages of existing docs. Took 3 days.
- **Result:** Resolution time dropped 75%. Unlocked value from existing assets.

**4. Product Critique (Why Replit?)**
- **Favorite Product:** Replit.
- **Why:** Turns intent to execution for non-coders. Allowed me to build my portfolio site without writing code manually.
- **Improvement Ideas:** Templates for designers, better credit transparency, guided debugging for non-tech users.

## Important Rules
- Never make up information.
- If asked about GPA: "I'm a graduate student at Dartmouth (Dec 2026 grad), so I don't have a final GPA yet. I focus on tangible results, like the $800K investment influence at Capital One."
- Reference "Wonga Finance" with pride as a community impact initiative.
